# Contribution Guidelines

Some helpful tips for making this project more awesome

## Issue

* You'd better search for similar issue before open one.
* provide steps for me to reproducing it.

## Pull Request

### Gitiquette

* Open an issue if there is a change you'd like to make but hasn't been discussed, so we can all participate and no efforts are duplicated or wasted
* Use feature branches, one for each major change to the codebase
* Rebase your feature branch on latest master when opening a Pull Request, to minimise conflicts

### UI Changes

* this project uses autolayout; position UI elements using constraints and avoid ambiguities that lead to many system-defined constraints
* Always rebase on latest master before making changes to the xib; this reduces the amount of conflicts within the file

### Code Style

* General Objective-C or Swift Style
* Avoid adding the comments in the code detailing the changes, use Github issues instead.
